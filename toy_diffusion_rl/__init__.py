"""
Toy Diffusion RL: A minimal PyTorch codebase for comparing 
diffusion/flow-based policies with various RL algorithms.

Algorithms implemented:
1. Diffusion Policy (imitation/offline RL)
2. Flow Matching Policy (vanilla, reflected, consistency variants)
3. Diffusion Double Q Learning
4. Consistency Policy Q-Learning (CPQL)
5. DPPO (Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization)
6. ReinFlow (Online RL fine-tuning for flow-matching policies)
